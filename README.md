(1) For total_laid_off, we noticed that the most frequent amount of laid off is 242 people. However, this is due t
(2)



- unbalanced datasets
- too many missing values in numerical features


Next steps:
- Handle missing values by (1)fill Null values with mean (2) drop rows contain NaN and add more datapoints from backup datasets.
